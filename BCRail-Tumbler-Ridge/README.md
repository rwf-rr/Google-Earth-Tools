# BC Rail Tumbler Ridge Sub Tours

Google Earth "My Places" files for the CN (ex BC Rail) Tumbler Ridge subdivision (British Columbia, Canada).

The main KML file contains everything. The additional files are subsets, places, paths and tours.

The finished videos are available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNVZq19_p0ChDbPvOcvpzLA).

## Settings

The basic settings for tours are in the `Tools --> Options --> Touring` menu, "when creating tour from a line". They apply to all tours.
I used the following settings:
- `Use 3D Imagery` is disabled. I found that there are a few areas that have bad 3D Imagery (not sure if this applies to the Tumbler Ridge area).
- `Camera Tilt Angle`: 80Â°
- `Camera Range`: 100 meters (this is the default; I did not experiment with it)
- `Speed`: 180 mph (240 would be better for a remote area with few details)

Path Properties:
- `Altitude`: 20 meters above ground
  * manually edited in path to 100 meter for the traversal over the top of the tunnel (should have a transition of at least 2 path points at 50 meter)

There are no tour specific properties.
