# BC Rail Takla Sub Tours

Google Earth "My Places" files for the CN (ex BC Rail) Takla subdivision (British Columbia, Canada).

The main KML file contains everything. The additional files are subsets, places, paths and tours.

The finished videos are available on ???.

## Settings

The basic settings for tours are in the `Tools --> Options --> Touring` menu, "when creating tour from a line". They apply to all tours.
I used the following settings:
- `Use 3D Imagery` is disabled. I found that there are a few areas that have bad 3D Imagery (not sure if this applies to the Takla sub area).
- `Camera Tilt Angle`: 80Â°
- `Camera Range`: 100 meters (this is the default; I did not experiment with it)
- `Speed`: 240 mph

Path Properties:
- `Altitude`: 20 meters above ground

There are no tour specific properties.
